*** Deleting Sites
    To delete a site from NoPanel, we need to be absolutely sure that we need to know the domain of the site in question, and we need to be darn sure that we aren't getting a blank domain and deleting all of =/var/www=:

#+NAME: delete_site_input_check
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  domain="$1"
  docroot="$(cd "/var/www/$domain"; pwd)"

  if [[ "$domain" == "" ]]; then
      echo "No domain provided." 1>&2
      exit 1
  fi

  if [[ ! -e "$docroot" ]]; then
      echo "'$docroot' does not exist." 1>&2
      exit 1
  fi

  if [[ ! -d "$docroot" ]]; then
      echo "'$docroot' is not a directory." 1>&2
      exit 1
  fi

  if [[ "$docroot" == "/var/www" ]]; then
      echo "Not deleting '$docroot'. Please double-check your input." 1>&2
      exit 1
  fi
#+END_SRC

Once we're sure of that, we can determine the Linux user for the site in question, and make sure it's a sane one:

#+NAME: delete_site_find_user
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  user="$(stat -c "%U" "$docroot")"

  if [[ "$user" == "" ]]; then
      echo "No user found for site '$domain'." 1>&2
      exit 1
  fi

  if [[ "$user" == "root" ]]; then
      echo "Not deleting user '$user'." 1>&2
      exit 1
  fi
#+END_SRC

Next we need to find the config file for the site:

#+NAME: delete_site_find_conf_file
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  conf_file="/etc/apache2/sites-available/$domain.conf"

  if [[ ! -f "$conf_file" ]]; then
      echo "Conf file '$conf_file' does not exist." 1>&2
      exit 1
  fi
#+END_SRC

Finally, we can start doing some damage. First, we disable the site's config:

#+NAME: delete_site_disable_conf
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  a2dissite "$domain"
#+END_SRC

Then, we delete the config file itself:
#+NAME: delete_site_delete_conf
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  rm "$conf_file"
#+END_SRC

Remove the document root:
#+NAME: delete_site_delete_docroot
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  rm -rfv "$docroot"
#+END_SRC

Finally, we delete the user:
#+NAME: delete_site_delete_user
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  userdel "$user"
#+END_SRC

...and reload the Apache config:

#+NAME: delete_site_reload_conf
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  service apache2 reload
#+END_SRC

And that's it! That site won't bother us any more.

#+NAME: delete_site
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :padline no :noweb yes
function delete_site {
<<delete_site_input_check>>

<<delete_site_find_user>>

<<delete_site_find_conf_file>>

<<delete_site_disable_conf>>
<<delete_site_delete_conf>>
<<delete_site_delete_docroot>>
<<delete_site_delete_user>>
}
#+END_SRC
