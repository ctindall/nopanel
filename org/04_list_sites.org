*** Listing Sites
    So far, we can create, delete, and backup NoPanel sites. What if we just want to list them? Due to the "convention over configuration" approach NoPanel takes, this is actually just a one liner, but we'll pack the functionality into the final script anyway.

#+NAME: list_sites
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :padline no :noweb yes
function list_sites {
find  /var/www/ -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -printf '%f\t%u\n' | grep -v ^\\. | grep -v ^html | grep -v ^htpasswd
}
#+END_SRC

This simply finds all directories immediately beneath =/var/www= and filters out the default =html= directory that Ubuntu provides, as well as the =htpasswd= dir, where we keep Apache credential files (more on this later).
