** Installation
    So far, we've talked only about things that can be done once your server is already set up and running NoPanel. What, you might ask, do I do if I'm starting from a bare-nothing Ubuntu install? Fear not. NoPanel is intended to be simple to install. In fact, it's a single shellscript, =nopanel.sh=, which you will want to copy somewhere in your path and =chmod +x=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
~# cp nopanel.sh /usr/bin
#+END_SRC

Next, avail yourself of the =nopanel.sh install= command. It's quite a simple little function. First, we install all the necessary system packages:

#+NAME: install_packages
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  apt-get install -y haproxy apache2 bc letsencrypt php-imagick php-pear php-pecl-http php7.0 php7.0-bcmath php7.0-bz2 php7.0-cgi php7.0-cli php7.0-common php7.0-curl php7.0-dba php7.0-dev php7.0-enchant php7.0-fpm php7.0-gd php7.0-gmp php7.0-imap php7.0-interbase php7.0-intl php7.0-json php7.0-ldap php7.0-mbstring php7.0-mysql php7.0-sqlite3 php7.0-sybase php7.0-tidy php7.0-xml php7.0-xmlrpc php7.0-xsl php7.0-zip
#+END_SRC

Next, we install the HAproxy configuration:

#+NAME: install_haproxy_config
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  {
      cat <<HAPROXYCONF
      <<haproxy_config>>
  HAPROXYCONF
  }>/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
#+END_SRC

Finally, start Apache and HAproxy. Actually, we stop them first, in case one or the other is already running.

#+NAME: install_start_services
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
service apache2 stop
service apache2 start

service haproxy stop
service haproxy start
#+END_SRC

This leaves us with a few lines to get our system up and running:

#+NAME: install
#+BEGIN_SRC sh padline: no noweb: yes
function install {
<<install_packages>>

<<install_haproxy_config>>

<<install_start_services>>
}
#+END_SRC
